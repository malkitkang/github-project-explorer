ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction

GitHub is one of the most widely used platforms for open-source collaboration. However, exploring repositories efficiently can be time-consuming. The GitHub Project Explorer is a full-stack web application designed to simplify repository search, analysis, and management.

This project provides users with:

Repository search by name, language, and stars

Interactive data visualizations for repository insights

Ability to bookmark repositories and add personal notes

ðŸ”¹ 2. Objectives

Build a responsive web app with modern frontend technologies.

Integrate GitHub API to fetch repository data.

Provide data visualization for better insights.

Implement bookmarking and note-taking functionality using a backend database.

Deploy the app on reliable cloud platforms for public access.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Technologies Used
Frontend

React.js â€“ Component-based UI library

TailwindCSS â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for styling

React Hooks â€“ State & lifecycle management

Backend

Node.js â€“ Runtime environment

Express.js â€“ Web framework for REST APIs

MongoDB Atlas â€“ NoSQL database for bookmarks & notes

Deployment

Render â€“ Hosting backend & database connection

Vercel â€“ Hosting frontend (React app)

Other Tools

Chart.js & React-ChartJS-2 â€“ Data visualization (Pie, Bar, Line charts)

GitHub REST API â€“ Repository data fetching

Git â€“ Version control

ðŸ”¹ 4. System Architecture

Frontend (React + Tailwind)

User searches repositories

Displays results & charts in modal views

Allows bookmarking & note-taking

Backend (Node + Express + MongoDB)

Handles API requests for bookmarks & notes

Stores data in MongoDB Atlas

Acts as middleware between frontend and database

External API

GitHub REST API provides repository data

ðŸ”¹ 5. Features

âœ… Search repositories by name, language, stars
âœ… Display repo details in modal view
âœ… Interactive charts (Languages, Issues/PRs, Weekly Commits)
âœ… Bookmark repositories

âœ… Full-stack deployment (Render + Vercel)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Results

Successfully deployed frontend & backend.

Application runs seamlessly with real-time GitHub data.

Bookmarks and notes are stored persistently in MongoDB.

Charts provide clear repository insights.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Challenges & Solutions

Issue: Mismatch between saveBookmark and addBookmark caused deployment errors.
Solution: Fixed import/export consistency and redeployed.

Issue: Environment variables not loading on Vercel.
Solution: Configured VITE_API_URL properly in Vercel settings.

Issue: ChartJS hook errors.
Solution: Properly registered ChartJS elements in main.jsx.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Future Enhancements
